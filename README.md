# Pocketcast Collaborator

A command-line interface for Pocketcast that adds AI-powered features like transcription and search to your podcast listening experience. Built in just half a day as an experiment in AI-assisted development, inspired by [Simon Willison's post about Gemini transcription](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/).

## Requirements

- FFMPEG
- Ruby 3.0+
- [llm-gemini](https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini) for transcription
- ffmpeg for audio processing and seeking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/The-Focus-AI/pocketcast-collaborator.git
   cd pocketcast-collaborator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   brew install ffmpeg  # Required for audio processing
   pip install llm-gemini
   ```

3. Set up your Pocketcast credentials:
   ```bash
   cp config/pocketcast.yml.example config/pocketcast.yml
   # Edit config/pocketcast.yml with your credentials
   ```

## Usage

Start the application:
```bash
bin/pocketcast
```

### Episode Management Commands
- `f` Filter episodes (downloaded, starred, archived)
- `s` Search episodes by title or content
- `o` Change sort order (date, duration, podcast)
- `r` Refresh episode list
- `d` Download selected episode
- `*` Toggle star on selected episode

### Playback Commands
- `‚Üµ` Play/Pause
- `‚Üê` Skip back 30 seconds
- `‚Üí` Skip forward 30 seconds

## How It Works

1. **Episode Management**: 
   - Connects to your Pocketcast account to access your episodes
   - Maintains a local cache for quick filtering and searching
   - Supports complex filtering combinations (e.g., starred and downloaded)
   - Quick episode access via UUID prefixes

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Uses ffmpeg to extract audio segments for precise seeking
   - Handles various audio formats and bitrates automatically
   - Provides accurate playback position for transcript sync
   - Enables instant seeking without re-buffering

3. **Transcription**: 
   - Automatically transcribes downloaded episodes using Google's Gemini API
   - Displays real-time progress during transcription
   - Saves transcripts for future playback
   - Synchronizes transcript display with audio position

## Project Background

This project was built in just half a day (March 26, 2024) as an experiment in AI-assisted development. Inspired by Simon Willison's exploration of Gemini's transcription capabilities, I wanted to create a tool that would make podcast listening more interactive and searchable.

Using Claude in Cursor, we were able to rapidly:
1. Set up the basic Pocketcast API integration
2. Implement a robust terminal UI
3. Add audio playback with ffmpeg
4. Integrate real-time transcription
5. Create a synchronized transcript display

Check the [WORKLOG.md](WORKLOG.md) for the detailed development timeline and progress.
