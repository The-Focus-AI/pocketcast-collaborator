# Pocketcast Collaborator

A command-line interface for Pocketcast that adds AI-powered features like transcription and search to your podcast listening experience. Built in just half a day as an experiment in AI-assisted development, inspired by [Simon Willison's post about Gemini transcription](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/).

## Project Background

This project was built in just half a day (March 26, 2024) as an experiment in AI-assisted development. Inspired by Simon Willison's exploration of Gemini's transcription capabilities, I wanted to create a tool that would make podcast listening more interactive and searchable.

Using Claude in Cursor, we were able to rapidly:
1. Set up the basic Pocketcast API integration
2. Implement a robust terminal UI
3. Add audio playback with ffmpeg
4. Integrate real-time transcription
5. Create a synchronized transcript display

Check the [WORKLOG.md](WORKLOG.md) for the detailed development timeline and progress.
